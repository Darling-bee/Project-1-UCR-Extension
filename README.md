With everyone at home during the pandemic and alcohol sales at all time highs. People want to be able to enjoy the same drinks at their local watering hole while still being safe. Now there is an app that shows you how to do just that using the liquor you have in your own cabinet or bar. You choose the liquor and “The Alcocall App” tells you how to make your favorite cocktail. So use what you’ve got and get the party started!
